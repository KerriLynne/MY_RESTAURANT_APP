# My Restaurant APP

If you live in a city where Restaurants rule, you have most likely been asked (often) by non-residents to provide some restaurant options for their latest rendezvous to the city.
This application makes it easy to see reviewed restaurants by all users and also makes it easy to acess all restaurants that you have created and reviewed on the site.
